# OverTheWire wargames walkthrough
Welcome to my personal walkthrough of the [**OverTheWire wargames**](https://overthewire.org/wargames/) levels.

This repository serves as a documentation of the steps I followed to solve each level. The walkthrough is intentionally **minimalistic â€” focusing on core concepts** rather than complete solutions. The idea is to provide guidance while still encouraging you to think, experiment, and learn through hands-on effort â€” which I believe is the most rewarding way to approach these challenges (also meant for me when i will most probably come back after forgetting the steps ðŸ˜…)

Note: No passwords, or any sensitive credentials are included in this repository. If you happen to spot any such content accidentally exposed, please open an issue so it can be addressed promptly.

Happy hacking!
